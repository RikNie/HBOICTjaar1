Story

night falls and you're going home from a long day of work.
the road you always take is temporarly closed and you're forced to take an old road.
the old road is along side an abandoned campsite near a lake and a forest.
after driving for a while your engine suddenly starts stuttering and smoking.
you pullover alongside the road and step out of the car.
after looking underneath the hood you figure out your engine has some damaged components.
you start exploring the campsite for left over items to fix your engine.
while searching around you get the feeling that you're being watched.
make your search quick and fast before "IT" catches up.
